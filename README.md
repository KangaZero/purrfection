In this group project, we intend to create and develop an online pet store that is practical for either the following:
- Clients who would like to purchase the available pet(s) & 
- For clients who are selling their animals. 

# Features:

- Create an account as a official member by Sign ups. 
- Post an individual Advertisement about an animal that is currently available for Sale. 
- Allows users to delete their Advertisement. 
- Edit their existing profile details.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, by successfully launching this project, we had successfully applied and collaborated as a team in balancing our unique strengths in both efficiency & effective problem resolution.Â Â 

More importantly, we now understand the relative importance of web development theories which are essential to the everyday use that we have taken for granted.Â
